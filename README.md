# Current-Mirror-Ckt

A current mirror is a fundamental analog circuit used to copy or "mirror" the current from one active device (typically a transistor) to another, maintaining a consistent current regardless of variations in voltage or load. This is especially useful in analog integrated circuits for biasing and current regulation.

# Key Components and Concepts
Transistors (BJTs or MOSFETs):

The current mirror typically uses bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) or metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs).
In a BJT current mirror, the transistors are usually matched to ensure that the current flowing through them is proportional.
Matching of Transistors:

The most important factor for a current mirror is that the two transistors are "matched." This means their characteristics (such as base-emitter voltage or threshold voltage) are very similar.
In the case of BJTs, this typically involves matching the transistors in terms of size (e.g., both transistors are made from the same wafer and have identical geometries).
Operation Principle:

In the simplest configuration, one transistor (usually called the reference transistor) is set up to establish a known current. This current is mirrored onto another transistor (called the output transistor) via the voltage across their respective terminals.
The current in the output transistor is determined by the current in the reference transistor, assuming the two transistors are properly matched and in the correct operating region (active region for BJTs or saturation region for MOSFETs).
